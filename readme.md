# Test Instructins

Create a RESTful api that helps to manage musical instruments.  Each instrument should contain the following pieces of information:  

- name:  ex:  “Violin Delux 200”  (String. Required.)
- type: “instrument”   (String. Required.)
- category: “violin”  (String. Required.)
- subCategory:  ex: “strings”  (String. Required.)
- retailPrice: ex:  599.00   (Number)
- manufacturer: “Strativarius”  (String. Required.)

1) Sign in to your GitHub account and fork the following repo:

```
https:
```


1)  Create a *scripts* folder within your project.  Add a file named *load-data.js*.  Use this script to add the following instruments into a CouchDB database.  

> Remember to keep your API key and password (secret) safe.  For example, do not commit these credentials to your git repo.

x)  Your *README.md* should contain instructions on getting a developer up to speed on your project.  The readme should include a Getting Started section that provides instructions on how to:

- clone your repo
- install dependencies
- establish environment variables
- load data
- load indexes
- start the API

You should also provide documentation on each endpoint.  Provide the following details with each endpoint:

- HTTP Method (Ex:  GET)
- Path (Ex:  /cats)
- Path parameters  (Ex: /cats/{cat_id})
- Query Request Parameters (ex: ?limit=10)

Submit your test by sending Trip and Tom a direct message containing your GitHub repo url.  

Create the following endpoints:

- `POST \instruments`
- `GET \instruments`
- `PUT \instruments`
- `DELETE \instruments` (edited)
